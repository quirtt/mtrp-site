This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


# INCOMPLETE

## SiteMap
- / (mobile-first)
    - register (everything under this is pc-first)
        - personal-detals
        - exam-details
        - payment

So, for example, open [https://localhost:3000/register/personal-details](https://localhost:3000/register/personal-details) for personal-details page.

## TODO
- ~~Add main page~~
- ~~Get better fonts~~
- Ensure everything works for other aspect ratios.  
- Ensure main-page works for pc-first as well.
- More styling (?)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
